This project seeks to display the camera metrics of the Raspberry Pi Camera Module 3 and a USB Webcam using Grafana and Prometheus. 

The Pi Camera Module 3 is processed using a Raspberry Pi 5 8 Gb version (pretty powerful!)

The USB Webcam is processed using the new Arduino Uno Q, a collaboration between Qualcomm and Arduino (also very powerful, especially for the package/price).

Most of the coding was done on my MacBook, connecting to the microcontrollers using SSH. I'd like to give my thanks to oh-my-zsh for making the terminal experience even more pleasant. All the git commands were done using the terminal, GitHub desktop was not used at all.

This readme.md file was written (mostly) on my MacBook in neovim from the terminal.

Project operational! Full readme and demo video coming soon!
